# Problem Statement
Managing contacts manually using paper-based address books or basic digital notes is often inefficient, error-prone, and time-consuming, especially as the number of contacts grows. There is a need for a simple, reliable, and user-friendly digital solution that allows individuals to store, organize, search, and manage contact details efficiently.
<br>The Contact Book project aims to address this need by developing a Python-based application that enables users to add, update, delete, and search for contact information with ease, while ensuring data persistence through file handling techniques .
