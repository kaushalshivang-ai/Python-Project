# Problem Statement
Managing contacts manually using paper-based address books or basic digital notes is often inefficient, error-prone, and time-consuming, especially as the number of contacts grows. There is a need for a simple, reliable, and user-friendly digital solution that allows individuals to store, organize, search, and manage contact details efficiently.
<br>The Contact Book project aims to address this need by developing a Python-based application that enables users to add, update, delete, and search for contact information with ease, while ensuring data persistence through file handling techniques .

# Scope of this project
<br>Providing a user-friendly interface for users to add, view, search, update, and delete contact details including name, phone number, and email.
<br>Ensuring persistent storage of contact data through file handling, so contacts are saved and accessible across multiple program runs.
<br>Allowing easy retrieval of contact information with search functionality by name or other attributes, improving efficiency in managing contacts.

# Target Users
1\.College students who need a simple way to manage contacts for classmates, professors, and college-related activities.
<BR>Beginners in programming who want to practice Python concepts such as file handling, data structures, and user interaction.
<BR>Individuals looking for a lightweight, easy-to-use digital alternative to traditional paper-based address books.
